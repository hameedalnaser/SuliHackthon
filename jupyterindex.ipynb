Here are a few examples:\\n\\n1. Tomatoes: Tomatoes thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0-6.8, so a pH of 7 would work well. They also require moderate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\\n\\n2. Lettuce: Lettuce prefers a slightly alkaline soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0, so a pH of 7 would be ideal. It doesn't require high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium, so the levels in this soil should be sufficient.\\n\\n3. Broccoli: Broccoli likes slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0-6.8, so a pH of 7 would be okay. It requires moderate levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\\n\\n4. Carrots: Carrots prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0-6.8, so a pH of 7 would be okay. They don't require high levels of nitrogen or potassium, but they do require moderate levels of phosphorus.\\n\\n5. Radishes: Radishes prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0, so a pH of 7 would be fine. They don't require high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium, so the levels in this soil should be sufficient.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many other plants that could be grown in this soil. Ultimately, the best plants to grow will depend on your location, climate, and specific growing conditions.\"\n",
